## Abstract

The term "Big Data" encompasses the enormous quantities of data that are produced daily fromvarious sources, including finance, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing. The sheer volume,velocity, and variety of this data can be overwhelming, but with the right tools and techniques, itcan be harnessed to derive valuable insights. This specific problem,Tripartite IntegerPartitioning Problem, consists of three large textfiles consisting of millions of rows of integersand 50 columns. Given a positive integer λ, we must calculate 3 rowsLA, LB, LCin files A, B, Crespectively so thatLA(n) + LB(n) + LC(n) = λ.In order to find a valid solution, a complicatedalgorithm must be applied. By taking the first column of each text file and applyingLk(n) ≡ r(mod 10), wherekis each text file andris the remainder,we can simplify and narrow down thenumber of valid rows. Then by applying a hashmap function to each column where {key:value}is {Lk(n) ≡ r (mod 10):the index of the correlatedvalue} we can further isolate the valid rows.Ideally, this algorithmic solution can reduce the number of possible rows by just over half eachtime and complete the problem as close toO(n)runtimeas possible. Practical applications of thissolution can lead to correlation properties which can improve services in areas such as wirelesscommunication, drug design, cryptography, and radar technology.

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer λ and 3 text files A, B, and C, each having k columns and 10 million rows, the goal is to find 3 rows LA, LB, LC in files A, B, C respectively such that:

```scss

LA(1) + LB(1) + LC(1) = λ
...
LA(k) + LB(k) + LC(k) = λ
```
## Desired Outcome

The solution should work for a 3-way matching with files A, B, and C having 10 million rows each and around k = 40 columns. The number of rows can vary, but the order of magnitude should be 10 million.

## Algorithm

The current solution under development uses a combination of hash-threading to achieve the desired results. The algorithm creates a 2D array as a sort of hash table to store the first column value indexes of file B. A hash table allows for O(1) lookup of any element by using the element as an index. The algorithm then calculates the Bx value by using the equation A - (λ - C) = Bx and searches for the Bx value in the hash table. If a value is found within B, the indexes of A and C along with the hash table within B are stored. Once all potential combinations are stored, they are processed using threads. Each thread checks a specific combination of A row, B row, and C row to verify if all elements are equal to λ. If a thread fails to meet this requirement, it is released, and a new combination is tested.

## General Steps

1. Grab the first  coloumn of file A file B file C

2. place each of them into their own seperate hash 1000 slots long (k<=1000) k is defined 
   as the value of a number in the files. Each number in the coloumn represents its position in the hash.
   the values stored are the indexes of the numbers. So if 35 is found at index 3,7,8 in col a----> col a hash 
   slot 35 will contain string "3,5,8".

3. for coloumn  of a b and c, loop through a and c hash
    if a[i] hash slot empty or c[j] hash slot empty, continue
    else do eqaution b_val=lam-j-i. check b_hash[b_value]. if is
    empty string continue else store (i, b_val, j) in a potential array.

4. gather all the potentials for a col 1, b col 1 ,c col 1 so that they are in seperate sets

5. repeat steps 1-4 for coloumn two of A,B,C

6. do intersection of sets Acol1 and A col2, B col 1 b col 2 , c col 1  c col 2

7. repeat step 2 but this time add a constraint to only hash the values which are found within the intersection

8. repeat step 3

9. loop step 7 and 8 for all coloumns of A B and C (starting from coloumn three as steps 1-6 use the first two col)
